An example of the similarity would be that a calculator is not a truly necessary tool, but exists to save time and effort. but there is no denying that ChatGPT can be used with malicious intent, in classes that require an extended opinionated written portion to be completed. 

I would say you should not use chatGPT as a citation, as the website gives you a formatted, organized collection of information that it gathered from other sources, instead of using data that it researched itself. 
in other words, ChatGPT gathers information and is not a source itself. ",""
